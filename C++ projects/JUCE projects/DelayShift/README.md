DelayShift
created By: Jack Barnes 07/18

This plugin started as a simple delay similar to the JackDelay plugin, a pitch shift and a reversed delay buffer have been added, the preformance of these are still being tweaked.
Very much a work in progress, will produce unpredictable results with full spectrum audio, but with a narrow range signal such as a single oscillator synth it can acheive some pretty cool pad like sounds.
