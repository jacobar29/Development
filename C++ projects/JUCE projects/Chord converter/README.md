A simple C++ application for transposing chords.
Text is extracted from the input box, added to a vector, seperated into the base chord and any suffixes (m7, sus3 etc), 
the base is then recombined with its suffix and passed to the output window.
This app has been converted from a QT application so that it may be built more easily into a single EXE file with no external dependencies
