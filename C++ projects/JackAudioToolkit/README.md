JackAudioToolkit is a collection of tools for audio synthesis and manipulation.

This includes:

JackOsc - an oscillator with options for sin/square/saw/triangle wave and white noise generation
JackEnv - a simple ADSR envelope
JackFilter - A low / high pass filter with resonance and cutoff variables, currently based on the maximilian maxifilter algorithm, soon to be replaced with one of my own but until then many thanks to the maximilian devs at https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian
