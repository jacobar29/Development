A simple C++ application for transposing chords created using the win32 api.
Text is extracted from the input box, added to a vector, seperated into the base chord and any suffixes (m7, sus3 etc), 
the base is then recombined with its suffix and passed to the output window, if a chord diagram exists for the transposed chord it is displayed under the output window.

This app has been converted from a QT application so that it may be built more easily into a single EXE file with no external dependencies

a prebuilt version of the application has been included, this is ready to go with all the resources required included in the folder.
