A gridbased music making app created using python and pyQt, with the numpy and pyGame libraries.
The app consists of an 8X32 button grid representing 8 tones on the c major scale each with 32 steps.
Each row of buttons triggers both a square wave and a sine wave at each step.

sliders control the cycle rate, Sine wave volume, Square wave volume, attack, and cycle length. a button is given to 'clear' the pattern

n.b there may be some issues with window size on smaller screens, dynamic window scaling based on monitor size will be implemented in the next revision.
